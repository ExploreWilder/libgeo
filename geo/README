libgeo: Geospatial support library

Dependencis:
    * geometry
    * imgproc
    * math
    * utility
    * dbglog
    * [ OpenCV ]
    * [ Boost_PROGRAM_OPTIONS ]
    * Boost_FILESYSTEM
    * PROJ
    * GDAL
    * GEOGRAPHICLIB

Tips:

    * Setting environmental variable GEO_DUMP_GDALWARP to non-empty value
      instructs geo::GeoDataset::warpInto() function to log command=line for
      gdalwarp utility.

      Variable must be set during program start, later changes (by user code)
      have no effect.
